    <p>I am passionate about solving complex challenges and delivering results, no matter the field. Currently, I serve as a software engineer at Meta, where I focus on scaling the training of machine learning models. Previously, I <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Products-and-Solutions/HPC/Hands-On-with-Intel-at-Exascale/post/1517389">led a team dedicated to scaling a machine learning prototype for production-level particle physics simulations</a>. My experience also includes <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/aurora-supercomputer-ranks-fastest-for-ai">contributing to the development of deep learning frameworks for the supercomputer Aurora</a> and creating <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/provably-exact-artificial-intelligence-nuclear-particle-physics-0924">expressive machine learning models for particle physics simulations</a>. I hold a PhD in Theoretical Physics and <a href="https://rhodes19.org/racing/national-champions/">have a keen interest in sailing racing</a>. I welcome connections, and LinkedIn is the best platform to reach me.</p>
