When I was in high school, I went to an open day at our university and asked where I could work if I studied physics. The answer was straightforward: you can work anywhere. Years later, after earning my Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics, I believe this more than ever. A solid foundation in physics and mathematics prepared me for any job.

In my career, I've always been involved in interdisciplinary research, focusing on important topics and new trends. During my master's, I applied new methods to graphene, a material that won a Nobel Prize and was the talk of the physics community. I then moved into applying AI to physics and vice versa, before it became widely popular. Now, I work on scaling the LLAMA model, focusing on how to make hundreds of thousands of GPUs work efficiently together to train advanced AI models.

I've realized that I love solving complex challenges and delivering results, no matter the field. I also enjoy working with people, leading teams, and helping others succeed.
